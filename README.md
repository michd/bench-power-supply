# Bench power supply

I'm working (currently just researching and prototyping) on developing my own bench power supply. This repository will mostly act as a working directory before it gets anywhere near completion, so expect stuff to move around a lot.

## Some requirements / desired features for the supply:

- DC output voltage of 1.5V - 35V (ish)
- Output current of up to 2.5~3A (ish)
- Voltage and current limit digitally adjustable, probably through rotary encoders
- Present output voltage and current displayed on LED 7 segment displays
- Additional (LCD?) display for setting the voltage and current limit (definitely need a way to view the current limit when it's not being reached)
- Maybe some USB ports (3?) providing 5V / 1A per port.
